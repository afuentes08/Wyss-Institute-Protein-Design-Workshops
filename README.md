# Wyss Computational Protein Design Workshops
The LCD platform is hosting a workshop event at the Wyss Institute covering the basics computational protein design, current workflows and de novo design strategies. This is geared towards experimentalists who work in protein engineering who'd like to learn about the newest machine learning driven protein design tools. No prior experience needed!

## [Theory Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kaDj9Jek2pOlp9u5BuWBrlPiCu8cP5Phw2dSMDV3gFA/edit?usp=sharing)
The first component is a short lecture on the theory behind designing proteins from scratch.

## [Interactive Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabDesign/blob/main/rf/examples/diffusion.ipynb)
Here is a comprehensive demo notebook from Ovchinikov lab at MIT which allows users to run the full protein design pipeline discussed in the lecture. 

## Additional Resources
### [Alphafold2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb)
### [Alphafold3](https://alphafoldserver.com)
### Colabfold
ColabFold is an open source collaboration also from Ovchinikov lab which is an open source alternative to alphafold. The repo is a great resource which includes links to multiple [notebooks](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold)

to get updated version of docs, pull files from github(app) and open them in vscode. 
hello this is a test.
