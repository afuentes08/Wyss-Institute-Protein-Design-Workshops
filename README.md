# Wyss Computational Protein Design Workshops
Welcome to the Wyss Institute protein design workshops covering the basics computational protein design, current workflows and de novo design strategies. This is geared towards experimentalists who work in protein engineering who'd like to learn about the newest machine learning driven protein design tools. No prior experience needed!

<b> What to take away from this workshop: </b>
1. Understanding of cutting-edge machine learning models for protein design
2. Tools for the modern protein design pipeline downloaded on your computer
3. A *de novo* mini-binder protein you designed! 

# Before the Workshop 
## Hardware requirements 
These following items are required for running software for this workshop!
1. Laptop or PC
2. ~70GB of available storage
3. Terminal authorization 

## Linux Command Line Cheat Sheet
Linux is used to navigate and download the necessary software through terminal on both Mac and Windows for this workshop. Basic familiarity with these key commands will be very helpful for this workshop and for computational work in general (we will use them throughout the workshop, no need to memorize them!):

# Workshop Walkthrough: Install Dependencies
<b> A few packages need to be installed before we can download and run the 3 machine learning models which comprise the protein design pipeline (RFDiffusion, ProteinMPNN, Alphafold): </b>

## On Mac
1. Install [anaconda distributor](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
- Follow the conda instructions for Mac
- Open Terminal 
- Confirm conda has been properly installed by typing <pre> conda --version </pre> and enter
2. Install homebrew
- Navigate to folder where you want to store the software
  <pre> cd /Users/jiasquared/Desktop/Wyss </pre>
- Make and enter new directory
  <pre> mkdir protein_design_software && cd protein_design_software </pre>
- Type  <pre> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" </pre> and enter
- Confirm homebrew has been properly installed by typing <pre> brew --version </pre> and enter
2. Install wget
- Type <pre> brew install wget </pre> and enter

## On Windows
1. Install [anaconda distributor](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
- follow the conda instructions for Windows
2. Install wget via [GNU](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm)
- Make and enter new directory 
 <pre> mkdir protein_design_software && cd protein_design_software </pre>


# Install RFDiffusion
1. Ensuring you are in the protein_design_software folder, clone repo
<pre> git clone https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFdiffusion.git <pre>
2. Install model weights (this step will take ~5 minutes)
<pre> cd RFdiffusion </pre>
<pre> mkdir models && cd models </pre>
<pre>
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4/Base_ckpt.pt
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/e29311f6f1bf1af907f9ef9f44b8328b/Complex_base_ckpt.pt
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/60f09a193fb5e5ccdc4980417708dbab/Complex_Fold_base_ckpt.pt
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/74f51cfb8b440f50d70878e05361d8f0/InpaintSeq_ckpt.pt
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/76d00716416567174cdb7ca96e208296/InpaintSeq_Fold_ckpt.pt
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/5532d2e1f3a4738decd58b19d633b3c3/ActiveSite_ckpt.pt
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/12fc204edeae5b57713c5ad7dcb97d39/Base_epoch8_ckpt.pt
</pre>
3. Install NVIDIA SE3nv transformer
*Note, NVIDIA CUDA GPUS are not supported for Macs. The following instructions are to adjust RFDiffusion to be compatible with MacOS, which means running solely on CPU, which is slower than with GPU.*
## On Mac
- Ensure you are in the RFdiffusion directory <pre> cd RFdiffusion </pre>
<pre> conda env create -f env/SE3nv.yml </pre>
<pre> rm env/SE3nv.yml </pre>
<pre> vi env/SE3nv.yml  </pre>
- A new file will open up. Press the i key and *INSERT* should appear at the bottom of the screen <br>
- Copy the following code into the file:
<pre>
name: SE3nv
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.9
  - pip
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - pytorch
  - torchvision
  - torchaudio
  - pip:
      - dgl   
</pre>
- Press esc and type <pre> :wq </pre> to save and quit the file 
<pre> conda activate SE3nv </pre>
- The command line should look like this when you are in the SE3nv environment

## [Theory Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kaDj9Jek2pOlp9u5BuWBrlPiCu8cP5Phw2dSMDV3gFA/edit?usp=sharing)
The first component is a short lecture on the theory behind designing proteins from scratch.


## [Interactive Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabDesign/blob/main/rf/examples/diffusion.ipynb)
Here is a comprehensive demo notebook from Ovchinikov lab at MIT which allows users to run the full protein design pipeline discussed in the lecture. 

## Running in Notebooks
### [RFDiffusion](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabDesign/blob/main/rf/examples/diffusion.ipynb)


## Additional Resources
### [Alphafold2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb)
### [Alphafold3](https://alphafoldserver.com)
### Colabfold
ColabFold is an open source collaboration also from Ovchinikov lab which is an open source alternative to alphafold. The repo is a great resource which includes links to multiple [notebooks](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold)

to get updated version of docs, pull files from github(app) and open them in vscode. 
hello this is a test.
